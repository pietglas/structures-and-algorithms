Implementation (in progress) of a feedforward neural network in C++. For the linear algebra I use the Eigen library, which I chose because it is header-only and it has
a high STL-flavour over it. 

I'll a description once it's working. There are already several implementations out there (also in C++). The main purpose of this project is for me to get more experienced with modern C++ features such as smart pointers and multithreading. 

The code is largely based on Michael Nielsens (to my taste very well written) book with accompanying Python code "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", which can be found here: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html.
